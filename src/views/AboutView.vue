    <h1>About this project</h1>
    This has been created as a project for fun as a way to practice vue and create a dnd 5e character sheet page that's lightweight and works pretty on pretty 
    much anything that has a somewhat modern web browser. This is offered as-is, if you lose an important character sheet or something on this one, I'm sorry.
    <br/>

    If I ever dabble in making similar character sheet pages for other ttrpgs, I'll link to ways to get to them here.

    TODO: Probably write more out here, but for now this is good I guess lmao.
